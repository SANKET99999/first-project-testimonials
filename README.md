## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my first project/ challenge :)

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible (as given in the design forlder).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
